# WebGl DnD Test:
https://crisdiaz-github.github.io/Webglprueba/

This is a WIP test build. Im having fun making a virtual table for tabletop RPG sessions like DnD.

Currently there are only basic functions like:

-Throw dices and choose their color.

-Select and move objects around.

-Move, rotate and zoom the camera with your mouse.

-Simple walls creation and editing, for future maps creation with vision mechanics and fog of war.

-Option to change the graphics quality and a option to change how much time for the dices to be cleaned.


### Controls:

Rotate the camera holding right click.

Move the camera holding the wheel button and zoom it with the wheel scroll.

You can select objects with left click and then drag them holding left click.

#### In wall editing mode: 
Press left click to create the start of a wall and the wall will follow your mouse then left click again to set the end of the wall and release it.
