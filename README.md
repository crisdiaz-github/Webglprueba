# WebGl DnD Test:
https://crisdiaz-github.github.io/Webglprueba/

This is a WIP test build. Im having fun making a virtual table for tabletop RPG sessions like DnD.

Currently there are only basic functions like:

-Throw dices and choose their color.

-Select and move objects around.

-Move, rotate and zoom the camera with your mouse.

-Simple walls creation and editing, for future maps creation with vision mechanics and maybe fog of war.

-Option to change the graphics quality and a option to change how much time for the dices to be cleaned.
