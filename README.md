This is a WIP test build. Im having fun making a virtual table for tabletop RPG sessions like DnD.

Currently there are only basic functions like:

-Throw dices and choose their color.

-Move objects around.

-Move, rotate and zoom the camera.

-Option to change the graphics quality and a option to change how much time for the dices to be cleaned.
